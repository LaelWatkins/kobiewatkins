<p> 
Aaron Miller is an accomplished musician whose broad experience in many styles defines his double bass playing: jazz and classical, 
contemporary and popular, chamber and solo. He performs with an energy and enthusiasm that is palpable. Aaron is in high demand as a soloist, 
performer, educator, and clinician throughout the United States of America and abroad. He has been a guest for the Gene Harris Jazz Festival

and premiered four new works for the double bass that feature improvisation as an essential element. Starting in 2007, he joined the faculty of 
Brigham Young University-Idaho where he directs the double bass studio and the jazz combos program. Miller’s students have received regional and 
national recognition including the Downbeat student music award in 2008. Aaron has spent the past 3 years completing his doctoral degree from 
Northwestern University where he studied with Andrew Raciti. Miller has shared the stage with David Liebman, Bob Mintzer, Mark Levine, Joe Lovano,

      <h4>Ryan Nielsen, <small>trumpeter</small></h4>
<p>
 Praised for the &quot;breathtaking singing quality of his sound, tremendous instrumental skill, and outstanding creativity&quot; by jazz icon, John McNeil, Ryan Nielsen 
 is recognized as a musician whose lyricism is profound, whose versatility is rare, and whose artistry grows out of a love of groove, spirit, and beautiful 
 melody. He grew up in a musical home in rural Idaho, where his Father’s love of classical music mingled with his Mother’s love of Barry Manilow ;-) He began 
 performing professionally at 17, often alongside his brother, pianist Justin Nielsen. He has since been a guest artist at concerts and festivals throughout 
 the Western United States, including the Gene Harris Jazz Festival, the Sun Valley Jazz Festival, and the Salt Lake City Jazz Festival.
</p>
<p>
 His musical studies have taken him across the country. At Arizona State University, he studied with world- renowned classical soloist and teacher, 
 David Hickman, and was the recipient of the Doc Severinsen award for outstanding classical and jazz trumpet. He later went on to pursue his doctoral 
 studies at the New England Conservatory of Music. While at NEC, Mr. Nielsen studied with John McNeil and Rakalam Bob Moses. He has gone on to record with 
 many musical luminaries, including Jon Bishop, Rakalam Bob Moses, John Lockwood, and Grammy Award Winning Bassist, Clark Sommers. He has performed 
 professionally with such icons as Harvey Mason, the New York Voices, Eric Marienthal, Kevin Mahogany, Brian Bromberg, Byron Stripling, Wycliffe Gordon, 
 Conrad Herwig, Delfeayo Marsalis, John McNeil, Tiger Okoshi, the Summit Brass, and has recently been named trumpeter in the Kobie Watkins Grouptet.
 </p>
<p>
 Nielsen&apos;s musical interests are diverse. He has performed and recorded jazz, classical, folk, bluegrass, country, americana, pop, and experimental 
 world music, resulting in three albums over the last few years: &quot;Weeds in the Wall&quot;, recorded with the band <em>Sister and Brothers</em>; 
 &quot;Out of Nowhere&quot;, released on Jazz Hang Records; and &quot;Divine Colors&quot;, a project lead by his brother Justin. 2016 will see the release of 
 Nielsen’s first solo album, a collaboration with musical visionary Rakalam Bob Moses due to be released under the title &quot;Matzevah&quot; by Native Pulse Records.
</p>
<p>
Nielsen's love of teaching has garnered him a reputation as a passionate and inspiring clinician throughout the west. He is as enthusiastic about the art of 
teaching as he is about the art of music. He is currently professor of trumpet and jazz studies at Brigham Young University-Idaho.
